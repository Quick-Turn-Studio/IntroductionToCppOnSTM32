Part 1:
Implement vector, that allocates in creation time memory for given number of elements.
We use RAII so vector should deallocate memory when is destroyed.
Vector allows to add, remove elements.
size() method informs how many elements currently store vector
Do not misslead size() with capacity() that returns maximum number of elements.

Part2:

Implement copy constructor and assignment operator. Syntax:
Class(const Class& copyFrom)
Class& operator = (const Class& assignFrom)

Part3:

Implement move constructor and move operator. Syntax:
Class(Class&& copyFrom)
Class& operator = (Class&& assignFrom)
