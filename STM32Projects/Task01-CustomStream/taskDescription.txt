Implement operators that will save provided data to buffer.
Flush means sending to output, so in this case to messageSender::send() from messageSender.h

Example usage:

OutputStream myStream;
int age = 10;
myStream << "I am " << age << " years old";
myStream.flush();

Advance syntax

myStream << "I am " << age << " years old" << stream::endl;
